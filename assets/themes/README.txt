Placeholder images would be created here. For a live project, you would add actual theme preview images in the assets/themes directory.

THEME IMAGES

For proper display on the website, you need to add the following theme preview images:

1. ecommerce-preview.jpg - An image representing the e-commerce theme
2. portfolio-preview.jpg - An image representing the portfolio theme
3. course-preview.jpg - An image representing the course selling theme

Recommended image size: 800x450 pixels or similar 16:9 aspect ratio.

You can use any appropriate images for these themes, or create placeholder images with services like:
